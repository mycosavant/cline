# Enhanced Tool Execution Framework

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for enhancing the tool execution framework in the Roo-Code VSCode extension, addressing current limitations and providing a robust architecture for complex tool execution patterns.

## Current State Analysis

The current tool execution framework has several limitations:

1. **Limited Multi-Tool Support**: While there is basic support for sequential and parallel execution, it lacks robust dependency management and error handling.
2. **Rigid Execution Flow**: The current implementation doesn't support complex execution patterns like conditional execution or dynamic tool chaining.
3. **Limited Context Sharing**: Tools have limited ability to share context and results between executions.
4. **Parsing Inconsistencies**: The XML-based parsing approach has limitations when handling complex nested structures.
5. **Lack of Tool Composition**: There's no formal way to compose tools into reusable workflows.

## Enhanced Architecture

### 1. Tool Execution Core

The enhanced tool execution framework will be built around a central execution engine that supports:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Tool Execution Engine                      │
├─────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────┤
│ Sequential  │    Parallel     │  Conditional   │ Composite  │
│ Execution   │    Execution    │   Execution    │ Execution  │
├─────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────┤
│                    Execution Context                        │
├─────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────┤
│  Parameter  │     Result      │   Dependency   │   Error    │
│  Management │    Handling     │   Resolution   │  Handling  │
└─────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────┘
```

### 2. Execution Modes

#### Sequential Execution
- Enhanced dependency chain management
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Progress tracking and resumability
- Transactional execution (all-or-nothing semantics)

#### Parallel Execution
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Result aggregation strategies
- Partial success handling

#### Conditional Execution
- Condition evaluation based on previous tool results
- Branching execution paths
- Fallback mechanisms
- Dynamic tool selection

#### Composite Execution
- Tool composition into reusable workflows
- Nested execution contexts
- Input/output mapping between tools
- Workflow versioning

### 3. Execution Context

The execution context will provide:

- Shared state between tool executions
- Parameter validation and transformation
- Result caching and reuse
- Dependency tracking and resolution
- Error propagation and handling
- Execution metrics and telemetry

### 4. Integration with Event Bus

The tool execution framework will integrate with the event bus in the coding-memory module:

- Publish tool execution events (start, progress, completion)
- Subscribe to external events for conditional execution
- Enable cross-component coordination
- Support for distributed tool execution

## JSON-Based Tool Call Format

To address the limitations of XML parsing, we propose a JSON-based alternative format for tool calls:

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "mode": "sequential",
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "read_file",
        "toolId": "read_main",
        "params": {
          "path": "src/main.js"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "write_to_file",
        "toolId": "write_main",
        "dependsOn": "read_main",
        "params": {
          "path": "src/main.js",
          "content": "console.log('Hello, world!');",
          "line_count": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Benefits of JSON format:
- Native support in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Better handling of nested structures
- Easier validation with JSON Schema
- More compact representation
- Better tooling support

## Tool Composition Patterns

The enhanced framework will support several tool composition patterns:

### 1. Pipeline Pattern
Tools are executed in sequence, with each tool's output feeding into the next tool's input.

```
Tool A → Tool B → Tool C
```

### 2. Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern
A single tool triggers multiple parallel executions, followed by an aggregation step.

```
          ┌→ Tool B1 ┐
Tool A ───┼→ Tool B2 ┼→ Tool C
          └→ Tool B3 ┘
```

### 3. Conditional Branching Pattern
Execution path is determined by the result of a previous tool.

```
          ┌→ Tool B1 (if condition)
Tool A ───┤
          └→ Tool B2 (if not condition)
```

### 4. Retry Pattern
Failed tool executions are automatically retried with configurable backoff.

```
Tool A → [Fail] → Retry → [Fail] → Retry → [Success] → Tool B
```

### 5. Fallback Pattern
If a tool fails, an alternative tool is executed instead.

```
Tool A → [Fail] → Fallback Tool A' → Tool B
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework Enhancement

1. Refactor the existing tool execution framework to support the enhanced architecture
2. Implement the execution context with shared state management
3. Enhance sequential and parallel execution with improved dependency handling
4. Add support for JSON-based tool call format alongside XML

### Phase 2: Advanced Execution Patterns

1. Implement conditional execution with dynamic branching
2. Add support for composite tool execution
3. Develop retry and fallback mechanisms
4. Create a tool composition DSL for defining complex workflows

### Phase 3: Integration and Optimization

1. Integrate with the event bus in the coding-memory module
2. Implement performance optimizations (caching, lazy execution)
3. Add telemetry and monitoring capabilities
4. Develop comprehensive testing framework for tool compositions

## Migration Strategy

To ensure backward compatibility:

1. Support both XML and JSON formats for tool calls
2. Provide adapters for existing tool implementations
3. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
4. Create migration utilities for converting existing tool compositions

## Conclusion

The enhanced tool execution framework will provide a robust foundation for complex tool interactions, enabling more powerful and flexible automation capabilities in the Roo-Code VSCode extension. By addressing the current limitations and introducing advanced execution patterns, the framework will support the evolving needs of AI-assisted development.
