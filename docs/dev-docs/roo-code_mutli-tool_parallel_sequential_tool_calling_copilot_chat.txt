mycosavant: Review the Roo-code project's codebase to address key limitations in tool_use, which is currently limited to one tool call per response, and system prompting, which is inefficient and error-prone. Develop a comprehensive strategy that includes: conducting a thorough analysis of these issues; enhancing tool_use to support multiple calls as needed; optimizing system prompting for improved efficiency, accuracy, and reduced error rates; minimizing user costs by decreasing input/output tokens and API calls; and bolstering overall system robustness through error handling and reliability enhancements. Prioritize immediate optimization of the applyDiff tool, while evaluating existing tools and prompts, creating new ones to replace outdated v1 components, ensuring all modifications maintain backward compatibility where required, and performing comprehensive testing to validate changes. As one potential solution to deprecate current methods, integrate MCP server and client systems for all VSCode, filesystem, and command-line operations, thereby eliminating inefficient prompts and the 1:1 call/response model. Utilize VS Code API reference tool to design and execute effective tools.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you develop a comprehensive strategy to address the limitations in tool_use and system prompting in the Roo-code project. Let me first gather more information about the project structure to understand the current implementation better. Let me search for more specific information about the applyDiff tool that was mentioned as a priority for optimization: 

mycosavant: efforts should be constrained to the ./roo-code/ extension. The others are modules for now

GitHub Copilot: I'll focus my analysis and strategy development on the roo-code extension specifically. Let me begin by exploring the project structure to better understand the current implementation of tool use and system prompting. Let me look at the applyDiffTool.ts which was mentioned as a priority for optimization: Let me also examine the Cline class which seems to be the core component that handles the tool usage: Now I need to understand more about how the tools are registered and how they're processed. Let me look at how tool calls are being handled within Cline.ts: Let me search more broadly for tool handling in the Cline class: Let me check how tools are processed in Cline: Let me examine the files related to tool execution more generally to understand how the tool calls are currently being processed: Let me first get information about the VS Code extension API to understand what we're working with: Let me check how the system prompt is structured in the Roo code extension: Let me also check how the tools are registered and processed in the core part of the application: Let me check the main Cline class to understand how it handles tools: Let me look for the file that handles parsing of assistant messages:

GitHub Copilot: I'll continue with developing a comprehensive strategy to address the limitations in tool_use and system prompting in the Roo-code project. Let me further analyze the project structure and key components to better understand how tools are currently processed. Now let me check how the Cline class processes the messages and tool usages: Based on my analysis of the Roo-code project structure, I now have a better understanding of how tool usage is currently implemented and where improvements can be made. Let me outline a comprehensive strategy to address the key limitations in tool_use and system prompting as requested.

# Comprehensive Strategy for Tool Use and System Prompting Optimization

## 1. Analysis of Current Implementation

### Current Tool Use Implementation:
- The Roo-code extension currently supports one tool call per assistant response.
- Tools are defined in index.ts and parsed in parse-assistant-message.ts.
- Tool execution happens in individual tool implementation files in `src/core/tools/`.
- The system prompt in system.ts explicitly states: "You can use one tool per message".
- The parsing logic only supports sequential execution of tools.

### Current System Prompting Issues:
- System prompts are verbose and static.
- Each tool has its own section in the system prompt, creating token inefficiency.
- Error handling relies on providing verbose explanations in the system prompt.
- Current implementation leads to high token usage for both input and output.

## 2. Enhancement Strategy for Multiple Tool Calls

### A. Tool Use Structure Update:
1. Extend the `ToolUse` interface in index.ts to include execution modes:

2. Update the parse-assistant-message.ts file to handle multiple tool calls within parallel/sequential blocks:

Let me fix the issues in the parse-assistant-message.ts file:

```
Let me fix the parse-assistant-message.ts file completely: Summarized conversation historyI'll continue working on enhancing the tool_use functionality in the Roo-code project. Let me first get more context about the core files we need to modify. Let me check the current state of the parse-assistant-message.ts file: Let me see the index.ts file to understand the interfaces and types: Now let me check the Cline.ts file to understand how tool calls are handled: Let me look at the section in Cline.ts that handles tool execution: Let me search specifically in the Cline.ts file: Let me check how tool execution is handled in Cline.ts: Let me search for ToolUse related methods in Cline.ts: Let me also search for how content blocks are handled in the Klaus class: Based on my research, I'll now implement changes to complete the enhancement of the parallel and sequential tool execution in the Roo-code project.

Let's start by fixing the parse-assistant-message.ts file to correctly handle parallel and sequential tool execution blocks: 
```


Made changes.

I need to fix the issues in the parse-assistant-message.ts file. Let me update it properly: Let me see the rest of the file: Let me now re-implement the entire file correctly:

GitHub Copilot: Summarized conversation historyI'll continue implementing the solution for addressing the tool_use limitations in the Roo-code project. Let's look at the current progress and determine the next steps. Summarized conversation historyI'll continue working on implementing parallel and sequential tool execution functionality in the Roo-code project. Let's start by examining the relevant files to understand how tool calls are currently being executed and what changes we need to make. Let me examine the core files related to the assistant message parsing and tool execution in the Roo-code project. Now let's look at the part of Cline.ts that handles tool execution to see how tools are currently being executed: Summarized conversation historyI'll help you implement parallel and sequential tool execution functionality in the Roo-code project. Let's start by examining the core files in more detail to understand what changes are needed. Let's examine the main Cline class to understand how tool execution is currently implemented: Let's continue reading the Cline.ts file to find where tool execution happens: Let's continue reading the file to fully understand the tool execution process: Now let's examine the parse-assistant-message.ts file to understand the existing parsing logic for parallel and sequential tool blocks: Let's also look at the assistant message type definitions: Now that I understand the structure of the codebase and what needs to be implemented, let's look at how the tool execution happens in more detail: Now, let's examine how tools are currently executed to understand what needs to be modified to implement parallel and sequential execution: Now I need to check the shared tools interface to fully understand it: Let's also understand how the `presentAssistantMessage` function is handling tools: Summarized conversation historyI'll help you implement the parallel and sequential tool execution functionality for the Roo-code project. Based on your conversation summary, I understand that the parsing logic for these execution modes is already in place, but the execution engine needs to be updated to handle grouped tool calls.

Let's start by examining the current implementation of tool execution in the Cline.ts file. Now let's look at the current implementation of the `presentAssistantMessage` method in Cline.ts: Let me continue reading the Cline.ts file from where I left off: Let's examine the parse-assistant-message.ts file which contains the parsing functions for parallel/sequential blocks: Let's examine the index.ts file to understand the ToolUse interface: Now that I have a good understanding of the codebase, let's implement the parallel and sequential tool execution functionality. I need to modify the `presentAssistantMessage` method in Cline.ts to handle grouped tool calls.

Here's my plan:

1. Create a new function to execute tools in parallel
2. Create a new function to execute tools sequentially with dependency tracking
3. Modify the `presentAssistantMessage` method to handle grouped tool calls based on their execution mode

Let's start by implementing these new functions: 
````

````


Made changes.

I see the issue. There are several type incompatibilities between the `ToolUse` in the index.ts and the tools implementation. Let me check the shared tools.ts file to understand the tool structure better: Let's check the schemas.ts file to understand the ToolName definition: Let's continue reading schemas.ts: Now, let's examine how the formatResponse object is constructed to understand what we need for our implementation: Based on all the code I've examined, I can see that there are type incompatibilities between the ToolUse in index.ts and the tools implementation. Let's implement a solution that bridges these differences.

My approach will be to:

1. Create a function to handle parallel and sequential tool executions
2. Update the presentAssistantMessage method to support these execution modes
3. Make sure type conversions are handled correctly when calling tool functions

Here's the implementation: 

Made changes.

Now let's implement the core tool execution functions: 

Made changes.

Now let's update the presentAssistantMessage method in Cline.ts to handle groups of tools: 
````

````


Made changes.

Summarized conversation historyI'll continue working on implementing parallel and sequential tool execution functionality for the Roo-code project. Let's pick up where we left off and focus on resolving the type compatibility issues and updating the Cline.ts file to properly handle parallel and sequential tool execution.

First, let's examine the structure of the Roo-code project in more detail to better understand the files we need to modify. Let's read the Cline.ts file to understand how tools are currently executed: Let's continue reading more of the file to find the `presentAssistantMessage` method: Let's look for the `presentAssistantMessage` method which is key to our implementation:

GitHub Copilot: I'll continue implementing the parallel and sequential tool execution functionality for the Roo-code project. Let's first look at the `presentAssistantMessage` method in Cline.ts to understand how tool execution currently works: Let's continue reading more to find the tool execution portion: Let's continue reading to understand the remaining part of the `presentAssistantMessage` method: Let's continue reading the rest of the `presentAssistantMessage` method: Let's check the ToolUse interface in the assistant-message/index.ts file to understand the existing structure: Now, let's examine the `tool-execution` folder and its files: Let's look at the implementation of these files: Let's continue reading the index.ts file: Let's continue reading the index.ts file to see the parallel and sequential execution implementations: Now, let's check the content of `tool-helpers.ts`: Now I understand the current implementation. Let's check if the modifications to the `presentAssistantMessage` method in Cline.ts have been partially implemented: Let's look at the shared tools interface to understand the compatibility issues: Now that I have a good understanding of the codebase, I can see that we need to:

1. Update the `presentAssistantMessage` method in Cline.ts to handle parallel and sequential tool execution
2. Fix any type compatibility issues between the `ToolUse` interfaces

Let's make these changes: I need to try another approach. Let me use the `insert_edit_into_file` tool instead, which is more appropriate for adding new code: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now let's update the system prompt in `prompts/system.ts` to inform the model about the new parallel/sequential capabilities: Let's continue reading the system prompt to find the right spot to update: Let's continue reading to find the tool execution section: Now, let's find the appropriate spot in the system prompt to add information about parallel and sequential tool execution: 
````

````


Made changes.

Let's add more specific information about the parallel and sequential tool execution modes: 
````

````


Made changes.

It looks like we can't update the system prompt directly in this way because it's actually a backtick string template with many variables. Let's create a separate function to add the multi-tool execution information: 

Made changes.

Now, let's update the system prompt to import and use our new helper function: 
````

````


Made changes.

It seems we're having trouble with the template string in the system prompt. Let's modify the format of our system prompt update: I see the issue. It looks like the system prompt is a multiline string and we have already added the multi-tool execution information to it. Let's ensure the entire structure is valid. Let's read more of the file to find any issues: The system prompt has already been modified to include the multi-tool execution information, but we need to fix the XML formatting. Let's update it: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's update line 19 of the system prompt to add information about parallel/sequential tool execution: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's remove the multi-tool-execution.ts file since we've now incorporated its content directly into the system prompt: 
```


Made changes.


```
It seems there's an issue with the `multiAgent:` parameter in the system prompt. Let's check the format of the function definition: The `multiAgent` parameter doesn't have a type specified. Let's fix that: 
```


Made changes.


```
That's fine, the warning is just indicating that the parameter is not being used, but the error about missing type is fixed.

Now let's add a unit test to verify the new parallel and sequential tool execution functionality: Let's look for existing tests related to parsing assistant messages: Let's create a new test file for testing parallel and sequential tool execution parsing: 

Made changes.

Let's run the tests to see if our implementation works correctly: Summarized conversation historyI'll help you fix the remaining issues in the implementation of parallel and sequential tool execution functionality. Let's first examine the files with reported compilation errors. Let's continue reading this file: Let's also check the parse-assistant-message.ts file: Let's continue reading this file: Let's continue reading this file: Let's continue reading this file: Let's check the system-new.ts file: Let's continue reading the file: Let's look at the interfaces and tool execution code implementation: Let's continue reading this file: Let's check the tool-execution code: Let's continue reading: Now let's check tool-helpers.ts: Let's continue reading: Let's check the Cline.ts file to see the existing implementation for tool execution: Let's check the implementation details in the tool-execution directory: Let's look at the rest of the test file: Now, let's look at the implementation of the parallel and sequential tool execution functions: Let's continue reading the tool execution implementation: 

Continue to iterate?
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

mycosavant: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you fix the remaining errors and issues in the parallel and sequential tool execution functionality. Let's start by looking at the rest of the `executeToolsSequentially` function and any other relevant code. Let's now look at the modifications in the main Cline.ts file to see how it handles parallel and sequential execution: Let's look at the specific implementation in Cline.ts that handles parallel and sequential execution: Now, let's check the parse-assistant-message.test.ts for the actual test cases to understand the expected format: Now, let's look at the errors mentioned in the diff.ts file: Based on my analysis, I can see that there are several issues to fix:

1. In parse-assistant-message.ts - The parser is looking for `<parallel>` and `<sequential>` tags, but the tests are using `<multi_tool_use mode="parallel">` format.

2. In system-new.ts - There's an issue with the template literal.

3. In the implementation of multi-tool execution in Cline.ts, it's using a different tagging approach than what's expected in the tests.

Let's fix these issues one by one:

1. First, let's fix the parse-assistant-message.ts file: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's fix the `processExecutionBlock` function first to match the expected parameters: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's fix the remaining part of the parseAssistantMessage function to ensure it returns the content blocks: Let's instead create a new file for parse-assistant-message.ts: 

Made changes.

Now, let's fix the system prompt template issue: Let's create an updated version of the system-new.ts file: 

Made changes.

Let's update the Cline.ts file to handle the new multi_tool_use tag: Now, let's create a consolidated fix to put all these changes together:

1. First, let's implement our updated parse-assistant-message.ts:
