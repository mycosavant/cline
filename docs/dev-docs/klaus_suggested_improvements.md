# Suggested Improvements for Klaus

Based on current capabilities and potential enhancements:

## Key Improvement Areas

1.  **Deeper Semantic Code Understanding:** Move beyond syntax to grasp control flow, data flow, potential errors (NPEs, race conditions), and anti-patterns for smarter refactoring and bug detection.
2.  **Proactive Assistance & Suggestion Engine:** Instead of only reacting to prompts, Klaus could proactively identify opportunities in the open file or project.
    *   *Example:* "I notice this function has a high cyclomatic complexity. Would you like me to suggest ways to simplify it?" or "This file lacks error handling for the API call. I can add a try/catch block."
3.  **Enhanced Debugging Integration:** While Klaus can run commands, tighter integration with the IDE's debugger would be powerful.
    *   *Example:* Analyzing stack traces automatically when an error occurs in a run command, suggesting breakpoints, or inspecting variable values based on user queries during a debug session.
4.  **Project-Wide Context and Architecture Awareness:** Improve Klaus's ability to understand the relationships between different files and modules within the entire project, not just the CWD or explicitly mentioned files. This would enable more strategic advice on architectural changes or identifying the impact of a change across the codebase.
5.  **Learning and Personalization:** Allow Klaus to learn from user feedback, preferred coding styles (beyond linting rules), common patterns within the specific project, and corrections made by the user. This could be stored locally and factored into future responses and suggestions.
6.  **More Sophisticated Refactoring Tools:** While `replace_in_file` is powerful, dedicated tools for common, structured refactorings (like renaming symbols project-wide, extracting methods/variables safely) would be less error-prone and more efficient than relying solely on text replacement.

## Deep VS Code Integration Opportunities

Leveraging VS Code's rich extension APIs can make Klaus a more seamless and powerful coding partner:

1.  **Inline Actions & Context Menus (`vscode.languages.registerCodeActionsProvider`):** Offer contextual Klaus actions (Explain, Find Bugs, Refactor, Generate Tests/Docs) directly via lightbulbs or right-click menus on selected code.
2.  **Proactive Diagnostics (`vscode.DiagnosticCollection`):** Run background analysis and surface issues (complexity, missing error handling, security vulnerabilities) directly in the "Problems" panel with associated Code Actions to trigger Klaus fixes.
3.  **Enhanced Completions (`vscode.InlineCompletionItemProvider`, potentially `vscode.lm`):** Provide context-aware, multi-line "ghost text" completions informed by project context and Klaus's understanding.
4.  **Integrated Refactoring (`vscode.languages.registerRenameProvider`, Code Actions):** Use VS Code's language-aware refactoring capabilities (like Rename Symbol F2) powered by Klaus analysis, offering safer alternatives to text replacement.
5.  **Debugger Assistance (`vscode.debug` API):** Integrate with the debugger to automatically analyze errors/stack traces, suggest breakpoints, and allow natural language queries for variable inspection during debugging.
6.  **Seamless Source Control (`vscode.scm` API):** Integrate with the Source Control view to suggest commit messages based on diffs, provide buttons for Klaus-driven commits (`git_commit`), and visualize diffs (`git_diff`).
7.  **Klaus Tasks (`vscode.tasks.TaskProvider`):** Define complex, multi-step workflows (e.g., "Build, Test, Analyze") as custom VS Code Tasks orchestrated by Klaus.
8.  **Unified Chat Interface (`vscode.lm.sendChatRequest`):** Potentially allow users to interact with Klaus via `@klaus` within VS Code's native chat views for a more integrated experience.
9.  **Custom Views/Webviews Enhancements:** Use custom views to display Klaus-generated architectural diagrams, dependency graphs, or test coverage reports.
10. **Notifications & Status Bar (`vscode.window` API):** Provide non-intrusive feedback on background tasks and Klaus's status using standard VS Code UI elements.

## Effective Prompts for Different Modes

Leveraging the system prompt's rules (directness in ACT mode, planning in PLAN mode):

**ACT Mode Prompts (Direct Task Execution):**

*   **Refactoring:**
    ```
    Refactor the function \`fetchLegacyData\` in \`src/api/dataService.ts\` to use async/await syntax and add basic error handling using a try/catch block. Use \`replace_in_file\`.
    ```
*   **Implementation:**
    ```
    Implement a new function \`calculateDiscount(price, discountPercentage)\` in \`src/utils/pricing.ts\`. Ensure the percentage is handled correctly (e.g., 10 for 10%). Create the file \`src/utils/pricing.ts\` if it doesn't exist using \`write_to_file\`.
    ```
*   **Debugging:**
    ```
    The \`execute_command\` to run the server failed with the error provided in the previous message. Read the \`server.js\` file using \`read_file\` and analyze the setup around line 25 to identify the likely cause. Suggest a fix using \`replace_in_file\`.
    ```
*   **Adding Dependency & Usage:**
    ```
    Use \`execute_command\` to add the 'lodash' library using npm. Then, use \`replace_in_file\` to import the \`debounce\` function from lodash into \`src/components/SearchBar.tsx\` and apply it to the \`handleInputChange\` method with a 300ms delay. Ensure \`requires_approval\` is true for the install command.
    ```

**PLAN Mode Prompts (Strategic Discussion & Planning):**

*   **Architecture Design:**
    ```
    I need to add a real-time notification system to the application. Use \`plan_mode_respond\` to propose two potential architectures: one using WebSockets and one using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Discuss the pros and cons of each in the context of our current stack (Node.js/React).
    ```
*   **Feature Feasibility:**
    ```
    Is it feasible to integrate a third-party analytics service (like Mixpanel) into the user dashboard? Use \`list_files\` for \`src/dashboard\` to see the structure, then use \`plan_mode_respond\` to outline the necessary steps, potential challenges (like handling user consent), and estimated complexity.
    ```
*   **Refactoring Strategy:**
    ```
    The current state management in the frontend (\`src/contexts\`) is becoming complex. Use \`list_code_definition_names\` on \`src/contexts\` to understand the existing providers. Then, use \`plan_mode_respond\` to propose a plan for refactoring towards a more modular approach, potentially using Zustand or Redux Toolkit, and outline the migration steps. Include options for which library to use.
    ```
*   **API Design:**
    ```
    Design a REST API endpoint for fetching user profiles. Use \`plan_mode_respond\` to define the route (e.g., GET /api/users/:userId), expected request parameters, and the structure of the JSON response body, including potential fields like \`id\`, \`username\`, \`email\`, \`createdAt\`.
    ```

----
PREVIOUSLY:
The core idea is to make Klaus feel less like a separate chat panel and more like an intrinsic part of the coding workflow, providing contextual assistance directly within the editor and other VS Code UI elements.

Based on the system prompt's focus on structured, tool-driven interaction and the goal of being a highly skilled software engineer assistant, here are several key areas for improvement:

---

## Other VS Code APIs: Beyond the LM API, VS Code offers a rich set of APIs for integrating into almost every aspect of the editor:
languages: For code actions, completions, diagnostics, hovers, renaming, etc.
window: For notifications, status bar, input boxes, quick picks, webviews.
workspace: For accessing files, configuration, diagnostics.
commands: For registering and executing commands.
debug: For interacting with the debugging process.
scm: For interacting with Source Control Management (like Git). (version control, Github)
tasks: For integrating with the Task system.

---


Deeper Semantic Code Understanding: Move beyond syntax and basic structure to understand control flow, data flow, potential null pointer exceptions, race conditions, and common anti-patterns. This would allow Klaus to offer more insightful suggestions for refactoring, bug fixing, and optimization.

Proactive Assistance & Suggestion Engine: Instead of only reacting to prompts, Klaus could proactively identify opportunities in the open file or project.
Example: "I notice this function has a high cyclomatic complexity. Would you like me to suggest ways to simplify it?" or "This file lacks error handling for the API call. I can add a try/catch block."
