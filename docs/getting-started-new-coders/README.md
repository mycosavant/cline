# Getting Started with Klaus | New Coders

Welcome to Klaus! This guide will help you get set up and start using Klaus to build your first project.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   **VS Code:** A free, powerful code editor.
    -   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Development Tools:** Essential software for coding (Homebrew, Node.js, Git, etc.).
    -   Follow our [Installing Essential Development Tools](installing-dev-essentials.md) guide to set these up with Klaus's help (after getting setup here)
    -   Klaus will guide you through installing everything you need
-   **Klaus Projects Folder:** A dedicated folder for all your Klaus projects.
    -   On macOS: Create a folder named "Klaus" in your Documents folder

2.  **Input Your OpenRouter API Key:**
    -   Navigate to the settings button in the Klaus extension.
    -   Input your OpenRouter API key.
    -   Select your preferred API model.
        -   **Recommended Models for Coding:**
            -   `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`: Most used for coding tasks.
            -   `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`: A free option for coding.
            -   `deepseek/deepseek-chat`: SUPER CHEAP, almost as good as 3.5 sonnet

## Your First Interaction with Klaus

Now you're ready to start building with Klaus. Let's create your first project folder and build something! Copy and paste the following prompt into the Klaus chat window:

```
Hey Klaus! Could you help me create a new project folder called "hello-world" in my Klaus directory and make a simple webpage that says "Hello World" in big blue text?
```

## FAQs

-   **What is the Terminal?** The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It allows you to run commands to perform various tasks, such as installing packages, running scripts, and managing files. Klaus uses the terminal to execute commands and interact with your development environment.
